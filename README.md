# YouTube Distraction Lock
Lock YouTube with a Todo list user script, so you're forced into doing all your tasks before you can continue watching YouTube.

I made this for myself at 3 AM one time and wasn't planning to release it or anything, but I've decided I want to enrich my Github profile so I guess there's no harm in uploading it :)
